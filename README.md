# xClip
External Noclip Tool For GD Built In Python 3

## Installation
- Method I - Download From Releases
  - Go [Here](https://github.com/Scaratek/xClip/releases) and Download "xClip.exe"
- Method II - Running From Source
  - This requires Git and Python 3
  - `git clone https://github.com/scaratek/xclip` 
  - `cd xclip`
  - `pip install gd.py`
  - `pip install keyboard`
  - `python ./xClip.py`

## Usage
- Open GD
- Open xClip
- The Defualt Keybinding is "m"
  - To change the hotkey change "m" in `keyboard.add_hotkey("m", toggle_noclip)` to whatever you want the keybinding to be 
  - This only works if your running from source


## [WIP] Updates
- Change icon for the EXE and the window to be the icon I made
- Make an input field to choose a hotkey
- Make the GUI better
